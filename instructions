This section contains a reference for Viua VM instruction set, and
has a description of every available instruction; with documented inputs, outputs, and exceptions.

It is loosely modelled after Appendix A to William Hohl's 2009 book "ARM Assembly Language: Fundamentals and
Techniques" (ISBN 9781439806104).

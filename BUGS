* references work only in `iinc` and `idec` instructions,
  must augment code for arithmetic so it does not always create new objects but reuses old ones where possible or
  knows that it is a reference and updates all other objects,

* in `bstore` instruction it is possible to refer to a byte (with the `@<int>` syntax) - however, its range is limited and allows only to refer to registers between 0 and 127,
* comparison and logical instructions do not support short (two-operand) form,

* in CPU::run() if an exception is raised while in main loop and `return_exception` is set before `return_message`,
  `return_message` will be set to `return_message` for some reason...
* segfault when assembling "unchanged.asm" file
* stack trace details should inform hat there are no non-empty registers,
* linking a function two times shall be detected (this would create dead code),
* linking into bigger libs should be allowed,
* linking main should be allowed,
* functions should be checked only after all libs are linked,

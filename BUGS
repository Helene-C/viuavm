* define `byte` as `unsigned char`,
* update all files to use new `byte`,
* update CPU to use new bytecode definition,
* update assembler to use `bytecode/maps.h`,

* in `bstore` instruction it is possible to refer to a byte (with the `@<int>` syntax) - however, its range is limited and allows only to refer to registers between 0 and 127,
* comparison and logical instructions do not support short (two-operand) form,

But due to the move\naway from literals in non-constructor instructions, that\nhas changed, but the change was badly implemented.", "tags": ["viuavm"], "milestones": [], "project.tag": "viuavm", "project.name": "Viua Virtual Machine", "parameters": {"github_issue_no": "182"}, "close.author.name": "Marek Marecki", "close.author.email": "marejm@ozro.pw", "close.timestamp": 1503345216.603847, "closing_git_commit": "255454995eedd9a91085f95be262062117acd810"}

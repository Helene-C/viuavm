The \instruction{defer} instruction schedules a call to be executed just *after* the frame in
which this instruction is executed is returned from, but before the execution of the enclosing
frame resumes.

For example, if a deferred call to function `foo' is scheduled then the sequence of events is
as follows:

\wrap{begin}
\indent{2}
- execute a `defer foo/0' instruction
- schedule a call to `foo/0'
- encounter `return' instruction
- set return value in enclosing frame
- suspend current stack (let's call it S)
- execute all deferred calls (the process will execute their stacks)
- resume stack S
- pop the frame for `bar/0' function
\dedent{2}
\wrap{end}
\break

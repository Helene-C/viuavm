This instruction may be used to implement a RAII approximation.
You can create a value that needs to be finalised somehow (e.g. a socket needs to be
closed) you can
spawn the value,
obtain a pointer to it,
defer a call to a closing function and pass the value as a parameter by move.

The value is still available because the deferred call is scheduled after the
current function ends so the pointer you leave for yourself is still valid.

Also, this ensures exception safety - deferred functions are called even if the
frame is popped during stack unwinding after an exception is thrown.

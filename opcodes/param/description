Passes a parameter by value.
A copy of the value from the input register will be put into the output register in the call frame's
arguments register set, but the original value will be left in the input register after this instruction is
executed.

The input register is specified by the second operand.
The output register is specified by the first operand.
For example, the below code will pass a copy of the value in local register 2 as the first parameter to the
function to be called:

\wrap{begin}
\indent{2}
param %0 %2 local
\dedent{2}
\wrap{end}
\break

Requires a new frame to be active (spawned by \instruction{frame} instruction).

Compares two numerical values (either a float, or an integer).
If the left-hand side operand is an integer compares them as integers;
if the left-hand side operand is a float compares them as floats.

The result is the value of the following operation:

\reflow{off}
\indent{4}
result = lhs > rhs
\reflow{on}
\dedent{4}

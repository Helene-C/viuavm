Spawns a new call frame and puts it in the "new call frame" slot.
Spawned call frame contains two register sets:
arguments register set
and
local register set.

Size of the arguments register set is specified by the first operand.
Size of the local register set is specified by the second operand.

This instruction *MUST* be executed before any \instruction{param} or
\instruction{pamv} instructions are (they require a frame to be present
in the "new call frame" slot).

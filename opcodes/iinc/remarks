This instruction operates on 64 bit signed integers.
It is unreliable, in the sense that it uses the native int64_t type
which incurs all the negative properties of no overflow checking, wraparounds, etc.
However, it (the native type) is fast.


If you need safe, overflow-checked, version of this instruction look into checked
arithmetic on fixed-width bit strings.

\heading{ARGUMENT REGISTER OUT OF BOUNDS}

Thrown when the second operand of \instruction{arg} instruction references an index that is out of bounds for
the current call frame.
For example, indexes 2 and higher would cause this exception to be thrown on frames with two arguments saved
(or less); remember that register indexes are counted from 0.

\wrap{begin}
\indent{2}
.function: main/0
    arg %1 local %0  ; This instruction will cause an exception to be thrown.

    izero %0 local
    return
.end
\dedent{2}
\wrap{end}
\break

The above code would fail as the `main/0' function receives no arguments, and
yet it would try to access some in its body.

Spawns a new process.

When a new process is spawned it begins executing the function that was passed as the
second operand to the \instruction{process} instruction (full initialisation procedure
of new processes is described in section \ref{environment:processes:initialisation}).

Spawned process can be either "detached" or "joinable".
Each of these two states is described in more details below.

\heading{DETACHED PROCESSES}

A detached process (spawned using the \syntax{1} syntax) cannot be joined
using the \instruction{join} instruction (described in section \ref{opcode:join}).
Detached processes are independent of their parent processes and
can run even after main function finishes.

\heading{JOINABLE PROCESSES}

A joinable process (spawned using the \syntax{0} syntax) can be joined to obtain
the result of its execution (either a return value, or an exception).

\heading{FUTURES AND PROMISES}

A PID of a joinable process may be treated as a "future", and
the process identified by it may treat its final \instruction{return} instruction as
fulfilling a "promise".

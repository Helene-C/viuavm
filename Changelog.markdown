# Viua VM changelog

both internal and external APIs, and to the assembly language closest to
machine's core.

### Change catrgories

There are several categories of change:

- **fix**: reserved for bugfixes
- **enhancement**: reserved for backward-compatible enhancements to machine's
  core (e.g. speed improvement, better memory management etc.)
- **bic**: an acronym for *Backwards Incomparible Change*, these changes (possibly
  also enhancements) are backwards incompatible and
  may break software written in machine's assembly or using it's public APIs,
  BICs in internal APIs may not be announced here
- **feature**: resereved for new features implemented in the VM, e.g. a new
  instruction, or a new feature in a standard library
- **misc**: various other changes not really fitting into any other category,

# From 0.6.1 to 0.6.2

- bic: `throw` instruction no longer leaves thrown object in its source register;
  thrown object is put in special *throw-register* and the source register in
  currently used instruction set is made empty
- bic: `free` instruction was renamed to `delete` to better match the naming convections
  of the other object-lifespan controlling instructions (i.e. the `new` instruction)

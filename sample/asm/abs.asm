; this is the first program written for Viua VM that combines
; instructions to carry out an action that is not hardcoded as
; a standalone isntruction
;
; the purpose of this program is to find an absolute value of an integer

.function: main/1
    .name: %iota number
    .name: %iota zero
    .name: %iota is_negative

    ; store the int, of which we want to get an absolute value
    integer %number -17

    ; if the int is less than zero, multiply it by -1
    ; else, branch directly to print instruction
    ; the negation of boolean is just to use short form of branch
    ; instruction - this construction starts emerging as a pattern...
    if (not (lt %is_negative %number (integer %zero 0))) final_print
    mul %number (integer %iota -1)

    .mark: final_print
    print %number
    izero %0 local
    return
.end

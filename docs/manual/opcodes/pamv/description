Passes a parameter by move.
The value from the input register will be put into the output register in the call frame's
arguments register set, and it will no longer be available in the input register after this instruction is
executed.

The input register is specified by the second operand.
The output register is specified by the first operand.
For example, the below code will pass the value in local register 2 as the first parameter to the
function to be called (and then throw an exception because local register 2 will no longer contain a value):

\wrap{begin}
\indent{2}
pamv %0 %2 local
print %2 local      ; Invalid access because the value has been moved
                    ; by the `pamv' instruction above.
\dedent{2}
\wrap{end}
\break

Requires a new frame to be active (spawned by \instruction{frame} instruction).

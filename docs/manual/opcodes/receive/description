Receive a message.
Pops the first message in the message queue.

`\syntax{3}`, `\syntax{4}`, and `\syntax{5}` will pop the first message in the queue but immediately discard
it.

The timeouts (1s, 1ms, and infinity) specify for how long the VM should suspend the process if no message is
available in the queue.
These values are supplied by the programmer at compile time and are impossible to set dynamically (yet).

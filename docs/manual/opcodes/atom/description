Atoms are values that stand for themselves.
They are unique in the way that no two atoms are the same; however, there may be several instances of the same
atom.
As an example, there may be two atoms with the value 'foo' and they will be indistinguishable from each other,
but they will be radically different from a third atom with the value 'fooo'.

The only operation that atoms support is comparison for equality, using the \instruction{atomeq} instruction
described in section \ref{opcode:atomeq}.

Viua VM is programmed in an assembly language, which is only a thin layer of abstraction over
the underlying bytecode.
\break
The assembler that ships with the VM translates the source code one-to-one to bytecode:
the only "modifications" it does is the linking of different modules, and branch offsets calculation
- apart from that the bytecode is a direct translation
of what the programmer wrote.

Below you can find a documentation of the instructions the VM provides;
with explained syntax, example usage, specification of inputs, outputs, and exceptions.

The documentation is incomplete: not all instructions are documented yet.
For full listing of instructions, execute the `./build/bin/opcodes.bin' program that you can
find in a distribution of the VM.
